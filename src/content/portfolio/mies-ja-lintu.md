## About this Project

Portfolio design & development for Mies ja Lintu Oy/Pekka Astala, Senior web developer.  My tasks for this project included:

- Branding & Brand Strategy
- Content Strategy
- Web Design
- Web Development (NextJS)

The goal for this project was to remake Pekka's current website that's using a generic template to something more personable and customized, and help his website showcase his personality & interests while staying layed back and professional.  The client wanted his bird to be a center-piece of his brand, and having a cheeky twist to it.  The client really wanted the website to stand out and help his brand be memorable in the eyes of future clients or employers.


## Fun Facts

- The feathers sread accross the website are from Utu: they were manually scanned and uploaded.
- The project was truly a challenge in terms of responsiveness, but turned out to work fantastically on all device sizes

## Plans & Future Updates

- [ ] Animations/Interactions
- [ ] Robot.txt & Sitemap
- [ ] Finishing up modals
