## Project Overview
This portfolio website is a static Markdown site developed with Astro 3.0. It serves as my first experience using Astro.  I started the project by leveraging the "Astroship" theme, and tailoring its design and layouts to suit my project's unique needs.

In recent months, my focus has predominantly revolved around learning and implementing Next.js. However, for a content-rich, primarily static website, Next.js seemed a bit excessive. This realization led me to explore alternative solutions, ultimately leading to my decision to experiment with Astro.

## Development Experience

Choosing Astro over Next.js was driven by two key factors. Firstly, I was intrigued by Astro's capabilities. Secondly, it showcased increased efficiency. The lightweight structure of Astro, combined with its extensive collection of starter templates and themes, significantly reduced development time compared to Next.js.

While I initially also considered Jekyll, a framework I've worked with before, Astro stood out due to its compatibility with React in a Node environment. Motivated by positive feedback on the developer experience and enticed by the new transition animations introduced in version 3.0, I decided to give Astro a try.

The initial transition from React + Next.js 13 had a small learning curve: Despite Astro's support for React components, the experience notably differs, especially in terms of state management.  The deployment on Vercel also posed some challenges, but the well-crafted documentation from Astro proved invaluable in overcoming these hurdles.

Despite those minor challenges, crafting this site proved to be a swift and enjoyable process. Despite my lack of prior experience with Astro, I managed to have a deployable version ready in just two days.

I'm definitely easer to use Astro again in the future for similar types of projects.


<!-- ## Project Overview
This portfolio website is a static markdown site created using Astro 3.0. It's my first project with Astro. To begin, I used the "Astroship" theme as a starting point and customized its design and layouts to suit the project's needs.

In the past months, I have been very invested in learning and using NextJS, but it would have been an slightly "overkill" for a mostly static,  content-heavy website.  This need for a more adapted solution is why I opted for trying out Astro. 

Initially I considered Jekyll, as I had previous experience with they framework, but Astro was a very compelling option to me due to its compatibility with React in a Node environement.  After hearing about much praise about the developer experience with Astro, as well as the new transition animations introduced inversion 3.0, I was interested in trying it out.

Coming from React + Next 13, there was a slight learning curve before I found myself being comfortable.  Despite Astro supporting React components, it's definitely a much different experience when it comes to state management.  I came across some issues initially during deployment with Vercel, but thanks to well-written documentation on Astro's part, I managed to solve most of the issues I encountered.


## Development Experience

Developing this site was a quick and enjoyable process. Despite having no prior experience with Astro, I had a deployable version ready in just two days. I chose Astro over Jekyll due to its Node.js foundation and seamless compatibility with React, a technology I'm familiar with.

I opted for Astro over Next.js for two reasons. First, I was curious about Astro's capabilities. Second, it proved to be more efficient. Astro's lightweight structure and extensive collection of starter templates and themes saved a lot of development time compared to Next.js.

## Future Plans

I'm looking forward to using Astro for future projects, building on the experience gained from this one. -->
