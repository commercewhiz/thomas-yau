## Project & Requirements

For this project, I needed to build a customized e-commerce solution focused mainly on selling apparel and digital downloads.  The e-commerce solution needed to offer an easy and simple way to create and manage products and shipping, integrate with popular print-on.demand-services and an ESP, and offer a highly customized checkout experience for users.

I built a customized e-commerce platform using Shopify.  The requirements for this project included:

- Integration with popular **print-on-demand** services (Printify and Printful)
- Email marketing integration with an **ESP** (Mailerlite)
- Customized Cart experience
- Digital Product Downloads
- Product Bundles


## Solution

For this project, I opted for using Shopify, as it offers great out-of-the-box features for managing products, and has a large library of third-party plugins for easily integrating with print-on-demand and ESP services, and also for customizing the user checkout experience.

Besides being my first experience using Shopify, this project allowed me to get familiar with e-commerce needs for business applications, and gave me concrete hands-on experience in **implementing**, **marketing** and **designing** with sales as the driving goal.


 <!-- Although this project wasn't very heavily reliant on code, I got to learn the basics of the **Liquid template synthax**, and setup customizations for the website.

for this project, I needed a platform that could easily integrate with popular **print-on-demand** services, as I did not want to manage the **warehousing** of my products.  I also wanted more **flexibility** with the designs and a **low-risk** option for selling merchandise.  The rest of the store was going to be pretty simple as the rest of my products are mostly Digital Music downloads. -->

<!-- Besides product management, one of the most important aspects of this project for me was being able to integrate my store to my **Email Service Provider**, Mailerlite, so that I could keep track of the sales coming from **email marketing**.

This project was pretty simple and straight-forward, and frankly not extremely tech-intensive as plugins already existed to help with most of the project needs. Nonetheless I believe sometimes the most simple route is the best.  Using a pre-built solution for this was the best option for me as I needed to put up something quick and reliable that did not require a lot of customization. -->
