I'm a full-stack developer with a UI/UX design background based in Helsinki, Finland.  I am passionate about helping businesses make an impact by building and designing **effective and beautiful websites & web applications** that users will love.  I want to contribute to making the world a place where sharing knowledge and creative ideas is more accessible.

My mission is to make navigating the web a less frustrating experience for users.

When I'm not developing, I enjoy working on my many other creative projects.  You might find me playing the harp, recording vocals for metal bands from all over the world or producing music for my solo music project.
