## Step 1: Visit the Audience in Meta Business Suite

1. visit  https://business.facebook.com/
2. Navigate to the Audience

![Navigate to audience](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007918780594257953/1212683986888032316/cold-facebook-audience-01.png?ex=65f2baf9&is=65e045f9&hm=73243ae9e18c6cea2b9fedcd8d79155070320b125a7519891006758cd715a872&)

## Step 2: Create a ‚ÄúSaved Audience‚Äù

1. Name field
    - When creating the audience, make sure to give it an identifiable name you'll easily be able to remember when searching from the ad creation tools.
2.Audience Field
    - Select ‚ÄúPeople recently in this location‚Äù.  This is an extra safety measure to avoid bot traffic on ads.  Some bot accounts set their accounts to less suspicious countries.

Because of bot traffic on Facebook, a lot of locations are not ‚Äúsafe‚Äù for advertising: they are going to get you a lot of clicks, but not from real people.  This can really hurt the page‚Äôs performance if content is shown to the wrong people.  Make sure ton only select countries in this list.

### **"Greenlight" countries:**
- Austria
- Canada
- Denmark
- Finland
- Germany
- Ireland
- United Kingdom
- Netherlands
- New Zealand
- Norway
- Sweden
- Switzerland
- United States

> Pro Tip: You can add locations in bulk

Advertising to countries outside of this list is possible, but it‚Äôs best to create a separate audience and ad set for them and put a smaller limit on the budget to make sure it doesn‚Äôt get spent on bot traffic.

### Step 3: Interests Field

I usually try to add as many related interests as possible, including genre of music (metal, symphonic metal, power metal etc.  I also include similar bands that are targetable through Meta/Facebook

## Other info

I usually aim for audiences that are rather large (1-5M) when it comes to cold traffic.  Facebook algorithms usually do a pretty good job at pin-pointing what kind of people respond best.  Helping it a bit with interests is definitely great but being too specific won‚Äôt let Facebook auto-optimize properly.

The same concept applies for age and gender: I leave them pretty much open unless I‚Äôm trying to do something specific (i.e promoting a product that‚Äôs specifically for men or women)

## Summary

Here‚Äôs what my ‚Äúmain audience‚Äù for Elvann looks like.  I use this audience for gathering leads through lead ads, but leads are generally-speaking not the best objective for cold ads, but they work best for me specifically.  Testing what works and what doesn‚Äôt is a big part of getting good at running Facebook ads, and the creative is really where the magic happens.
